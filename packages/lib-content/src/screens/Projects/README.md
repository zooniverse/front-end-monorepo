# ProjectsPageContainer

This is the content for the Projects Landing page (`/projects`). It is intended to be imported into the App Router in app-root and configured with [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev/).

You can run lib-content's Storybook and view the UI of this page by fetching projects from `panoptes-staging`, but the filter interactions work only in app-root. Time spent researching NuqsAdapter x Storybook was intentionally deprioritized for now.
