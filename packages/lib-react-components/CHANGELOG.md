## [1.3.3] 2023-1-12

## [1.3.1] 2022-12-05

### Removed
- Removed source maps from webpack builds.

## [1.3.0] 2022-12-01

### Added
- Added an ES6 build for loaders that use ES Modules.

### Changed
- Use an `i18next` instance specific to this library, rather than modifying the default instance.
- Optimised `lodash` imports for tree-shaking.
- Replaced `mime-types` with `mime/lite`.
- Enabled the React automatic runtime.

### Removed
- Removed `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` and `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`.

## [1.2.1] 2022-11-03

### Added
- Export `useProgressiveImage` hook.

### Changed
- Removed `react-progressive-image` from the `Media` component.

## [1.2.0] 2022-10-03

### Added
- Added Grommet's `target` and `full` props to modal layers.
- Added standard width sizes to PrimaryButton according to design
- Localisation with `react-i18n`, including full Spanish translations!

### Fixed
- Changed `LinkList` component to use `fit-content` CSS styling to render correct height in Safari.
- Modified matchRegex in `ping` of `Markdownz` to avoid creating username-links in typed email addresses.
- Fixed buttons that could be rendered like disabled buttons, but still functioned as links. Grommet's `Button` allows you to add an `href` prop which will render a link (HTML anchor tag) styled like a button. It, however, accepts all `Button` props including `disabled`, but links can't be disabled. We now prevent this by checking to see if an `href` is defined and if `disabled` is true and instead render a span via the `as` prop. This impacts `PrimaryButton` and `PlainButton` which directly use Grommet's `Button`. For `CloseButton`, we've destructured `href` from the props to make sure it's not passed along because it doesn't make sense to render this component as a link.
- Markdownz wasn't handling ordered lists as expected. The fix includes upgrading `remark` to v12, installing `remark-footnotes`, and manually applying some style attributes to `<ol>` and `<ul>`.
- add the `react-rnd` `default`, `position` and `size` props to `MovableModal`.
- Allow `CloseButton` to be clicked on touch devices.
- catch errors in `Markdownz` during server-side rendering.
- Remove `header` tag and `presentation` role from `ZooHeader`.
- Replace deprecated Grommet `tag` with styled-components `as` in Grommet components.

### Changed
- All components use `react-i18next` instead of `counterpart` for translations management.

## [1.1.0] 2021-05-26

### Added
- Stories and readme for MetaToolsButton
- Custom theme object for `Markdownz` which defines styles for headings and anchors

### Fixed
- Allow for modals that can't be closed. [#1983]

- Restore default colours for the Modal and MovableModal components.
- Update Modal spacing to reflect the Zooniverse design system.
- Allow the colour of the Modal close button to be changed based on the ModalHeading text colour.
- Removed hardcoded margin-top from MetaToolsButton. Leave spacing to the consuming library.
- Removed the hardcoded cancel string for MovableModal applied to Rnd.
- Manually parse images in Markdownz children before passing to `remark` to provide backwards compatible custom img sizes previously used with `markdown-it-imsize`.

### Changed
- Updated text color on green `PrimaryButton` variant

### Removed
- Removed GoldButton component in favor of PrimaryButton which defaults to gold theme colors. Added GoldButton as an alias for the PrimaryButton export as to not make a breaking change.
