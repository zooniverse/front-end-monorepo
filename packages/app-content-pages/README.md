# Zooniverse Front End - Content Pages

A [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) app for handling the content pages

## Getting started

This package should be cloned as part of the [front-end-monorepo](https://github.com/zooniverse/front-end-monorepo).

You'll need to create a `.env` file containing the space ID and access token for Contentful:

```sh
cp env-default .env
```

To get the credentials, go to https://app.contentful.com/spaces/jt90kyhvp0qv/api/keys (login credentials are in Passbolt), and copy the Space ID and Content Delivery API token from "Testing".

### Running in development

```sh
npm run dev
```

Starts a development server on port 3000 by default.

**Note:** `PANOPTES_ENV` is set to `production` when running `npm run dev`. This is so the project avatars for publications can be fetched from the production API. If `PANOPTES_ENV` is set to anything else, the fallback image will show.

### Running in Storybook

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Starts a Storybook server on port 9001 by default.

### Running in production

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

Next.js [treats the build and serve tasks as separate steps](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#production-deployment) when running in production.

The production server is started on port 3000 by default.

### Tests

```sh
npm run test
```

See [Testing](#testing) for more details.
