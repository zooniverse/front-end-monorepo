# WelcomeModal

This modal is intended for use only during the first few weeks post-launch of the new homepages. It has a link to the relevant blog post, but is also dismissible via the close button, or the "take me there!" call to action. It uses local storage so when dismissed, it stays hidden across browser tabs. When no longer needed, please feel free to delete this code.
