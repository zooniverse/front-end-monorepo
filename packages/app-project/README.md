# Zooniverse Front End - Project

A [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) app for handling the project routes, including classification.

## Ops

- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.zooniverse.org/job/Zooniverse%20GitHub/job/front-end-monorepo/)
- [New Relic](https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/23619/applications/319037531)

## Getting started

This package should be cloned as part of the [front-end-monorepo](https://github.com/zooniverse/front-end-monorepo).

### Running in development

Starts a development server on port 3000 and a Storybook server on port 9001 by default.

#### Docker

- `docker-compose up -d` to run a dev server, in the background, on http://localhost:3000 and the storybook on http://localhost:9001.
- `docker-compose down` to stop the dev containers.
- `docker-compose run --rm project test` to run the tests.
- `docker-compose --rm project start` to run a production build on http://localhost:3000.


#### Node/yarn
```sh
yarn dev
yarn storybook
```
### Running in production

Next.js [treats the build and serve tasks as separate steps](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#production-deployment) when running in production.

The production server is started on port 3000 by default.

#### Docker
```sh
# to run a next prod server based on deployed prod image
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up project-app

# to run a next prod server based on local filesystem builds
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports dev start
````

#### Node/yarn
```sh
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Tests

See [Testing](#testing) for more details.

#### Docker
Run the whole test suite in the container and exit
```
# run the tests in the docker container
docker-compose run --rm dev test
```
Interactively run the test suite from a bash shell in the container
```
# launch an interactive bash shell in the dev app
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint="/bin/bash" dev

# change directory to the desired app (app-project)
cd packages/app-project/

# run the tests for this app
yarn test
```

#### Node/yarn
```sh
yarn test
```
