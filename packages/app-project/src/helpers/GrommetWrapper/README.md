# GrommetWrapper

This component handles a few things related to the Grommet theme:

- Creating a Grommet context
- Observing the UI store, fetching the `mode` property, and using that to set the `dark` boolean property on the theme
- Passing the theme into the Grommet context
- Setting a default screen size
