# Stat

A component that shows a value as large text, with a smaller label underneath it. Can be used with the `AnimatedNumber` component. Uses a `Box` as its containing element, so will also accept related props.

## Props

- `value` (component or string) - the value to show in large text
- `duration` (string) - the smaller text label
