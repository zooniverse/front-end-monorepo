# Static Image Assets

During development, new static image assets can be placed in this folder in order to see them when app-root is run locally. However, our frontend static image strategy is to place files in blob storage (e.g. https://static.zooniverse.org/fem-assets/exoplanet.jpg). When ready for deployment, use absolute urls to static.zooniverse.org instead of relative paths in this app.
