# Volumetric Task

The volumetric task is a task type designed for use with structured volumetric JSON, as part of an NIH neuron mapping project. The task is a drawing/click-oriented task that constructs volumetric annotation data based on the clicked point in 3D space.

The volumetric task requires subjects with a location of application/json mime type. The subject's location content is used to initialize the structured subject data to be annotated.

The volumetric task does not support a required property.

The volumetric task does not support tags (i.e. insertion, deletion).

The volumetric task is disabled until the subject is loaded.
