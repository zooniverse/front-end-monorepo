# VideoController

Used in SingleVideoViewer. Custom video controls are necessary for building drawing tools layers on top of a video subject. The `react-player` used to display a video subject has built-in controls, but their position overlaps some of the video. When an svg is placed on top of the player to record annotations, the built-in controls become unusable, hence the need for custom controls displayed below the subject.
