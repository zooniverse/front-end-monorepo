# Zooniverse Front-End Monorepo

This monorepo is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

## Conventions

### NPM

All packages built from this monorepo should be _scoped_ to `zooniverse`, e.g. `grommet-theme` becomes `@zooniverse/grommet-theme`.

### Packages directory

Libraries for publishing to NPM should have their directory names prefixed with `lib-`, e.g. `/grommet-theme` becomes `/lib-grommet-theme`.

Apps should have their directory names prefixed with `app-`, e.g. `/project` becomes `/app-project`.
