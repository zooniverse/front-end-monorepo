# Zooniverse Front-End Monorepo

## Requirements

[Browser support](docs/arch/adr-3.md)

## Monowhat?

This monorepo is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

Lerna allows us to maintain package modularity for javascript projects that have interdependency. Organizationally it allows us to track issues, pull requests, and progress for all related packages in one place. 

## How to get started

Installing dependencies for a particular package:

```
npm install -g lerna
cd packages/whatever
lerna bootstrap
```

If you want to contribute a new package and want to use a package in the monorepo, use `lerna add package-name` in the new package folder to get that package added to the `package.json`
