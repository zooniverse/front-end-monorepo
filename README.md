# Zooniverse Front-End Monorepo

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lernajs.io/)

## Requirements

[Browser support](docs/arch/adr-3.md)

## Monowhat?

This monorepo is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

Lerna allows us to maintain package modularity for javascript projects that have interdependency. Organizationally, it allows us to track issues, pull requests, and progress for all related packages in one place.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zooniverse/front-end-monorepo.git
cd front-end-monorepo
./bin/bootstrap.sh
```

The `bootstrap.sh` script will install the top-level dependencies, build any packages used as dependencies, and finally bootstrap the remaining packages.

## Helpful Guides

- [Lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting-guide.md) for developers encountering issues installing or running the Front-End Monorepo.

## Helpers

If you have [`plop`](https://plopjs.com/) installed globally, you can use it to quickly scaffold new apps and components. You can use the following generators:

- `App` - creates a new app in the `packages` folder, based on a simple Next.js 7 build, with Styled Components and Mocha included.
- `Component` - creates a new component in the current folder, including tests and an optional container.

## Conventions

### NPM

All packages built from this monorepo should be _scoped_ to `zooniverse`, e.g. `grommet-theme` becomes `@zooniverse/grommet-theme`.

### Packages directory

Libraries for publishing to NPM should have their directory names prefixed with `lib-`, e.g. `/grommet-theme` becomes `/lib-grommet-theme`.

Apps should have their directory names prefixed with `app-`, e.g. `/project` becomes `/app-project`.
