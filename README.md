## Monowhat?

This monorepo is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

Lerna allows us to maintain package modularity for javascript projects that have interdependency. Organizationally, it allows us to track issues, pull requests, and progress for all related packages in one place.

## Getting started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zooniverse/front-end-monorepo.git
cd front-end-monorepo
./bin/bootstrap.sh
```

The `bootstrap.sh` script will install the top-level dependencies, build any packages used as dependencies, and finally bootstrap the remaining packages.

## Helpful Guides

- [Lerna docs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting-guide.md) for developers encountering issues installing or running the Front-End Monorepo.

## Packages

A list of apps and packages and their main dependencies. See each package's folder for more specific readme documentation.

- **@zooniverse/fe-project** - Server-side rendered application for a project (anything at `/projects/owner/display_name`)
- **@zooniverse/classifier** - Classifier view components and state which can be exported modularly or altogether as a working classifier
- **@zooniverse/async-states** - Frozen object of async states to use in data stores
- **@zooniverse/grommet-theme** - The style definitions for a Zooniverse theme to use with Grommet
- **@zooniverse/panoptes-js** - Panoptes API javascript client. Functional HTTP request helpers built on top of superagent
- **@zooniverse/react-components** - A set of Zooniverse specific React components


## Helpers

If you have [`plop`](https://plopjs.com/) installed globally (`npm i -g plop`), you can use it to quickly scaffold new apps and components. The following generators are available:

- `App` - creates a new app in the folder, based on a simple Next.js 7 build, with Styled Components and Mocha included.
- `Component` - creates a new component in the current folder, including tests and an optional container.

## Conventions

### NPM

All packages built from this monorepo should be _scoped_ to `zooniverse`, e.g. `grommet-theme` becomes `@zooniverse/grommet-theme`.

### Packages directory

Libraries for publishing to NPM should have their directory names prefixed with `lib-`, e.g. `/grommet-theme` becomes `/lib-grommet-theme`.

Apps should have their directory names prefixed with `app-`, e.g. `/project` becomes `/app-project`.

## Production deployment

Deploys to production are handled by [Jenkins](https://jenkins.zooniverse.org/job/Zooniverse%20GitHub/job/front-end-monorepo/). Firstly, a base Docker image is created which installs and builds the `lib-` packages, and that's used as a base image for creating `app-` images, which are then deployed to Kubernetes.

More information is available in [ADR 12](docs/arch/adr-12.md).
