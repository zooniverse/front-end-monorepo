# Zooniverse React Components

Common React components used throughout the Zooniverse.

## Getting Started

Install the package from NPM:

```
npm i @zooniverse/react-components
```

and use it

ES5

```
var { ZooFooter } = require('@zooniverse/react-components');
```

ES6

```
import { ZooFooter } from '@zooniverse/react-components';
```

## Tests

`npm test` to run mocha tests.

## Contributing

Components should be added to the `src/components` folder and an export to `src/index.js`. Each component should be tested, documented readme, and have a storybook example added. 

### Technologies and tools we use

  All of our components are written using React, built on top of Grommet, a component UI library, and styled by our custom Grommet style theme (@zooniverse/grommet-theme) and styled-components.

  - [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/components) - React UI component library
  - [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)  - Component, virtual DOM based javascript library
  - [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS for styling and theming

  Testing is done by

  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - test runner
  - [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) - BDD/TDD assertion library
  - [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org) - test spies, mocks, and stubs
  - [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - testing utility for React
