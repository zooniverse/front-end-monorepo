The standard Zooniverse header to be used on Zooniverse sites. Built using:

- [React](http://reactjs.org/)
- [Grommet v2](https://v2.grommet.io/components)
- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

The header does not have light and dark theme variants. It remains black for both. 

The `signIn` (function), `signOut` (function), and `user` (object) props are required. These props can be defined using the API from @zooniverse/auth. See the development mini-app in the lib-auth folder for an example of using its API.
