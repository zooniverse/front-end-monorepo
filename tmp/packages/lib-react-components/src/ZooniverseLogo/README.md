# `ZooniverseLogo`

A component that renders the circular Zooniverse logo as an SVG.

## Props

- `id` (Required) - a unique id used to correctly label the component for screen readers.
- `size` - desired size of the logo. The SVG produced is square, so the same value is used for height and width. Defaults to `1em`.
