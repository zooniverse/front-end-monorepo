To volunteer, visit the <0>Projects page</0>, choose one you like the look of, and get started.","third":"The major challenge of 21st century research is dealing with the flood of information we can now collect about the world around us. Computers can help, but in many fields the human ability for pattern recognition—and our ability to be surprised—makes us superior. With the help of Zooniverse volunteers, researchers can analyze their information more quickly and accurately than would otherwise be possible, getting to exciting results more quickly. Your effort saves time and resources, advances the ability of computers to do the same tasks, and leads to faster progress and understanding of the world. Our projects combine contributions from multiple individual volunteers, relying on a version of the <0>\'wisdom of the crowd\'</0> to produce reliable and accurate results. Having many people look at the data often leads to better estimates of how likely we are to make an error. The products of Zooniverse projects are often exactly what\'s needed to make progress in many fields of research.","fourth":"Volunteers and professionals make real discoveries together. Zooniverse projects are constructed with the aim of converting volunteers\' efforts into measurable results. In some cases, Zooniverse volunteers have even made completely unexpected and significant discoveries. A substantial amount of this research takes place on Talk, the Zooniverse discussion boards, where volunteers work together with research team members and each other. These boards are integrated within each project to allow for everything from quick hash-tagging to in-depth collaborative analysis. There is also a <0>central Zooniverse Talk board</0> for general chat and discussion about platform-wide matters. We encourage all users to join the conversation on Talk for more in-depth participation."},"subheadings":{"first":"The wisdom of the crowd","second":"Anyone can be a researcher","third":"We accelerate important research by working together","fourth":"The Zooniverse Works","fifth":"Our projects lead to great discoveries"},"discoveries":{"first":"Green Pea Galaxies","second":"New Exoplanets Located","third":"An Earlier Use of \'White Lie\'","fourth":"Boyajian\'s Star","tip":"Click on any discovery for more info"},"stats":{"classifications":"Classifications so far","volunteers":"Registered volunteers"},"video":"A Brief Introduction to the Zooniverse"},"sidebarLabel":"Section","title":"About the Zooniverse"},"Article":{"url":"Read more"},"Collaborate":{"paragraphs":{"first":"Would your research benefit from the involvement of thousands of volunteers?

In order to launch publicly and be featured on our projects page, teams must go through our review process to ensure the project is appropriate for the platform and ready to be launched.

We work with these teams to apply for funding to support the research, design, and development process. Those who have applied for grant funding before will know that this process can take a long time. Once we’ve applied for a grant, it can take 6 months or more to hear back about whether or not our efforts were successful. Funded projects typically require at least 6 months to design, build, and test, depending on the complexity of the features being created. We then need additional time to generalize (and often revise) them for inclusion in the Project Builder toolkit. ","fifth":"If you are interested in partnering with us to create custom project tools or infrastructure, please <0>contact us</0>.","sixth":"Are you a researcher working on a project relevant to one of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate divisions (Astrophysics, Biological and Physical Sciences, Heliophysics, and the Planetary Science) who would benefit from contributions from Zooniverse volunteers?

Why can\'t computers do these tasks?"},"item1":{"answer":"For most of the subjects shown in Zooniverse projects, the researchers don\'t know the correct answer and that\'s why they need your help. Human beings are really good at pattern recognition tasks, so generally your first guess is likely the right one.
