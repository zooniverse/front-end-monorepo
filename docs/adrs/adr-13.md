# ADR 13: Contributing guidelines

Created: April 9, 2019

## Context

We are an open source project and as a result can possibly accept outside contribution to our codebase. To this end, we need to communicate our requirements for the code that is submitted and our process for acceptance of this code. The end goal for the rewrite is to be more modular which we believe will enable both the team and outside contributors flexibility and ease of adding enhanced features. 

## Decision

We will add a contributing guide to our documentation files. Once available, Github will show links to this guide automatically to any outside user visiting the front-end-monorepo repository. Any outside contributions must follow this guide to submit code for review.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

- Our respository will be more welcoming to outside participation.
- We can ensure new code follows our standards and that outside contributors are aware of what these standards are.
