# ADR 44: Image and Text Subject Viewer

7 April 2022

## Context
We should support subjects with an image location and a text location. The image and text views will be toggled with pill buttons below the image and text views. The image view can utilize the existing singeImageViewer and the text view can utilize the existing singleTextViewer.

The FEM image and text viewer will be used to support a project researching OCR verification (the DigiLeap project), with subjects that consist of an image and an OCR output as text file.

## Decision
Create an image and text viewer (ImageAndTextViewer) that utilizes the existing Single Image Viewer and Single Text Viewer.

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences
Create an image and text viewer (ImageAndTextViewer) that utilizes the existing Single Image Viewer and Single Text Viewer.
