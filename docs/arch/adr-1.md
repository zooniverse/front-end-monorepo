# ADR 1: Adopting Architecture Decision Records

July 19, 2018

## Context

The current generation of API, front-end apps and clients, and libraries were initially designed and programmed by very small group of people. Most of the architecture decisions were not documented or documented in an easily discoverable place. Now that it's been three years since the launch Panoptes API and Panoptes Front End, we have decided to do a significant rewrite of the front-end apps and clients. Part of this motiviation is to have a more collaborative architecture and design of the code using lessons learned in maintaining PFE and the javascript client. 

The ADRs are inspired by [this blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and should be used to document architecture decisions in the rewrite process.

## Decision

We will adopt ADRs to document app or library structure, conventions, dependency and technology choices. We will use the conventions outlined in the blog post linked to in the Context section.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

Adopting this documentation style should provide structure, documentation, and process to the architecture decisions made in the rewrite in an easily discoverable way.
